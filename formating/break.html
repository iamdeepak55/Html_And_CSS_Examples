    The rest of the day was a lazy one, partly spent by the complex
    pool, partly inside watching British TV, but we couldn't be doing
    this for the rest of the holiday. Already we were missing having
    the car!

    I decided to check out what the weather would be doing for the next
    few days, as that would help us make any decisions about future
    excursions.
